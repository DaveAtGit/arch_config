# arch_config

A collection of my various configuration- and settings-files for my ArchLinux.

Originally this is a more private repository but who cares. You are free to use
any of those files and/or snippets out of them.

For me, this repo is mainly a backup and used for fast VM-initializations. :)

## Something like a roadmap
