# arch_config

A collection of my various configuration- and settings-files for my ArchLinux.

Originally this is a more private repository but who cares. You are free to use
any of those files and/or snippets out of them.

For me, this repo is mainly a backup and used for fast VM-initializations. :)

## Something like a roadmap

- [ ] General configs
  - [ ] .config/
  - [x] .i3/
  - [x] .bashrc
  - [x] .vimrc
  - [x] .vim/
  - [x] .Xresources
  - [x] .xinitrc
- [x] automated linking (let's call it bootstrapping)
- [x] automated VM-setup
