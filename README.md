# arch_config

A collection of my various configuration- and settings-files for my ArchLinux.

Originally this is a more private repository but who cares. You are free to use
any of those files and/or snippets out of them.

For me, this repo is mainly a backup and used for fast VM-initializations. :)

## Something like a roadmap

- [ ] General configs
  - [ ] .config/
  - [ ] .i3/config
  - [ ] .bashrc
  - [ ] .vimrc
  - [ ] .vim/
  - [ ] .Xresources
  - [ ] .xinitrc
- [ ] automated linking (let's call it bootstrapping :smile:)
- [ ] automated VM-setup
